WEATHER PREDICTION PROJECT
In this project, I have build a model that can predict tomorrow's temperature using historical data. Started the project by downloading a dataset of local weather. 
I used ridge regression to train the model since the model performed poor,inorder to improve the model added more predictors.Again training the model with new predictors
the model performed better than before.There are many possible way we can imporve the model.

Project Steps

Download weather data
Clean and graph data
Create a testing framework
Improve model accuracy
